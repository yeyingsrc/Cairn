Cairn is a general-purpose problem-solving engine. <br/>It defines no roles, no workflows. Given an origin and a goal, it searches for a path through an unknown state space. <br/>AI Penetration Testing is one such problem — and a proven one.

## What is Cairn?

Penetration testing is fundamentally a **directed search through a near-infinite state space**:

- **Origin**: known (target IP, target system)
- **Goal**: defined (get a shell, capture the flag)
- **Path**: unknown

This structure is not unique to penetration testing. Vulnerability research, mathematical proof, CTF challenges — any problem with a clear starting point, a clear success condition, and an unknown path in between shares the same shape.

Cairn is built for this class of problems. Penetration testing is the first domain it has been validated on.

The engine is built on a **Blackboard Architecture** with an explicit fact-intent graph. Three primitives are all it needs:

| Concept | Meaning |
|---------|---------|
| **Fact** | A confirmed, objective finding written to the board |
| **Intent** | A declared direction of exploration, not yet executed |
| **Hint** | Human judgment injected at any time; absorbed by agents on the next read |

The graph grows from `origin` toward `goal`. Every new Fact is a stepping stone; every Intent is a step into the unknown.

Agent Workers run an OODA loop — Observe the full graph, Orient to the current state, Decide on next intents, Act to explore — and write their findings back as new Facts. Workers have no fixed roles. Tasks are generated at runtime from the graph's current state, not from predefined job descriptions.

Agents coordinate exclusively through the shared board (Stigmergy). No direct communication. No information silos.

## How It Works

Three task types, all executed by the same Worker:

| Task | What it does | Output |
|------|-------------|--------|
| **Bootstrap** | At project start, attempts to solve the problem directly | Fact + possible Complete |
| **Reason** | Reads the full graph: is the goal met? What should be explored next? | Complete / new Intents / no-op |
| **Explore** | Claims one Intent, executes the exploration, reports findings | One Fact |

System architecture:

```

```

**Cairn Server** maintains graph consistency only.

**Cairn Dispatcher** reads the graph, schedules tasks, spins up and tears down worker containers, and is the sole writer to the protocol. Each project gets its own Worker Container; multiple Agent Workers run concurrently inside it. Agent Workers only receive a prompt and return structured output.

Workers can also run directly on the dispatcher host instead of in per-project containers — **local mode**, no Docker required. See [Local mode](#local-mode-no-docker) below.

Supported worker backends: **Claude Code**, **Codex**, and **Pi**.

## Results

**Tencent Cloud Hackathon · AI Penetration Testing Challenge · 2nd Edition**

610 teams · 1,345 participants · top universities and security firms across China

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Problems solved | **54 / 54 — only team to AK** |
| Final ranking | 3rd |

> The system had never been tested before the competition. The full pipeline came online for the first time at 4 AM on race day. No training, no tuning, no domain-specific tooling. Zero MCP tools, zero RAG, zero predefined agent roles.

## Getting Started

**Prerequisites**
 
- macOS or Linux
- Python ≥ 3.12
- Docker (container execution only — not needed for local mode)


### Pull required images
 
Both setup methods require the worker container image:
 
```bash
docker pull --platform=linux/amd64 ghcr.io/oritera/cairn-worker-container:latest
```

Create your local dispatcher configuration and fill in your LLM endpoints and API keys:

```bash
cp dispatch.example.yaml dispatch.yaml
```
 
### Docker Compose (recommended)
 
Pull the base image used to build Cairn:
 
```bash
docker pull ghcr.io/astral-sh/uv:python3.13-trixie
```
 
```bash
docker compose up --build
```
 
This starts `cairn-server` on port `8000` and `cairn-dispatcher` once the server passes its health check. The dispatcher mounts `dispatch.yaml` from the project root and connects to Docker via the host socket. Data is persisted to `./datas/cairn/`.
 
### Manual
 
```bash
# Start the server
uv run --project cairn cairn serve
 
# Run the dispatcher
uv run --project cairn cairn dispatch --config dispatch.yaml
 
# Run startup health checks only
uv run --project cairn cairn dispatch --config dispatch.yaml --startup-healthcheck-only
```

### Local mode (no Docker)

Instead of one container per project, workers can run directly on the dispatcher host, reusing the machine's already-configured `claude` / `codex` / `pi` CLIs — no Docker, and no API keys in the config.

```bash
cp dispatch.local.example.yaml dispatch.yaml

# Start the server
uv run --project cairn cairn serve

# Run the dispatcher on the same host, where the CLIs are installed and logged in
uv run --project cairn cairn dispatch --config dispatch.yaml
```

Local mode is selected by `runtime.execution: local` (see `dispatch.local.example.yaml`). On startup the dispatcher checks each configured worker CLI is installed and runnable, and reminds you they must already be logged in. Each project gets an isolated working directory under `local.workspace_root` (default: the dispatcher's current directory). Run the dispatcher directly on the host — not inside Docker — since the agents run with your user's permissions and no sandbox.

### Tests

Run the fast regression suite without Docker or live model endpoints:

```bash
uv run --project cairn --group dev pytest
```
